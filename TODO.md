- figuring out how to get the "print" pop up menu on Windows 10.
    - Could be an admin issue. Testing on my personal machine to figure out if it is an admin issue.
    - CUPS/Printer sharing - archwiki

- need to add velocity profiles to the print-out, and potentially other information.

- potential bug when using octave gui: have to delete the following file: C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\octave\octave-gui.ini
- adding "getvelocity" to the main print function
- need the following in text file created:
    - at the top Height U V W Density
    - headers describing what each column is
SOLUTION
- create a completely seperate class and methods to pass values beween functions
- and in this case we are trying to get values from "getvelocity.m" -> "dismoor.m"
